# Dart Sorting Algorithms
Here I would like to recall concepts of sorting algorithms that we usually learn in courses but applying them in the dart language.

Sorting Algorithms are methods of reorganizing a large number of items into some specific order such as highest to lowest, or vice-versa, or even in some alphabetical order.
These algorithms take an input list, processes it (i.e, performs some operations on it) and produce the sorted list.

The most common example we experience every day is sorting clothes or other items on an e-commerce website either by lowest-price to highest, or list by popularity, or some other order.
